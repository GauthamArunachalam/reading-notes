# Dopamine Detox

## A short guide to remove distractions and get your brain to do hard things

- Thibaut Meurisse

# Introduction

- If we concentrate our time on single task we can make progress in our life in achieving our big dreams and goals. But we do no do that every morning we tend to check email, our stock portfolio and tend to spend time slip by without working on the actual job we need to work on.
- Soon enough the important task will become less appealing. As we do other activities and time passes by it creates a mental barrier between us and the task. This is due to overstimulation of our brain.

# Dopamine and the role it plays

- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that makes us anticipate rewards.
- Dopamine gives us the desire to take action to earn the exciting reward that's is waiting for us.
- Dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. 
- A simple event can trigger the release of dopamine but it doesn't mean it is something we like or get pleasure from.
- No amount of stimulation can bring us the sense of fulfillment. Yet many of us are overstimulated looking for the next source of event that can trigger the release of dopamine. The more we seek the worst it becomes
- Under an overstimulated brain any activity that requires concentration or mundane works becomes very difficult to perform.

## Action Step

> What are you addicted to?
> What are the main sources of stimulation?
> Do they really make you happy?

# The problem

- Dopamine can we seen as a **molecule of more**. The more our environment or actions trigger the release of dopamine, the more we'll want the next shot of dopamine. This self reinforcing mechanism is how addictions work.
- By continuously triggering the release of dopamine through different means we actually strengthen their tolerance to such stimulation. As a result, they need stronger and stronger stimulus to experience the same sensation of pleasure.
- If we can't spend a day without engaging in certain activities it means we are probably addicted to it.
- As we reduce our exposure to stimulating activities we increase our focus and boost our productivity levels.

## Action step

> Write down situations when you couldn't stop doing something. Write down activities that you cannot stay away from on whole day.

## Dopamine neurotransmitters are being hijacked

- Our focus is the most scarce asset, this is the reasons why companies spend billions to attract your attention. The more we spend time in social media and streaming apps the more they can generate revenue through adds. 
- One of the greatest tools they have developed and use in the modern day is the notifications. Which increases our dopamine effect to check that.
- A best example of your brain being hijacked is notifications. Whenever we see a notification we anticipate a reward you'll receive when clicking on it, which triggers the release of dopamine in your brain.
- The development of sophisticated algorithms to suggest content are not helping us it hooks us in a ever ending loop.
- These things hijacks our focus and makes us unproductive and restless
- There are many other activities that can hijack your brain visiting youtube, checking stock portfolio are some of them
- They risk overstimulation and result in loosing your focus.
- People who stay away from internet and social media for a few days, what a waste of time and focus such activities can be

### Food craving

- Experiments have shown that the combination of sugar and fat is especially effective in stimulating the brain's reward system
- Using this food industry adds sugar in most of the processed foods to increase our craving so we buy those products
- Sugar as addictive capability at the level of nicotine but not in the drugs like heroine

## Dopamine and constant stimulation can impair your ability to think long term

- One of the best predictors of success is the ability to think long term
- People who repeatedly focus on where they want to be in future tend to make better decisions in the present.
- Unfortunately, these days, focusing on our long-term goals isn't an easy feat. Many external forces lead us to become caught up in short-term thinking and encourage us to fall for immediate gratification.
- Social media and internet as a whole, have negative impact in out life's by not allowing us to think long-term and not allowing us to focus deeply on the task in front of us. 
- Apple CEO Steve Jobs prohibited his children from using phones or tables even thought is business is to sell those to his customers.
- Former executive of Facebook, Chamath Palihapitiya argues we must rewire our brain to focus on the long term, which starts by removing social media apps from our phones. In his words social media apps **wire your brain fro super-fast feedback**
- By receiving constant feedback through likes and comments we condition ourselves to expect fast results with everything we do.
- As we demand more and more simulation, our focus is increasing geared toward the short term and our vision of reality becomes distorted. this leads us to adopt inaccurate mental models like success should come quickly and easily. Don't need to work hard to lose weight or make money.
- Ultimately, this error prone models make our blurs our vision or reality and our perception of time. This makes us feel jealous about people who had overnight success. Makes feel inadequate, not enough and other negative feelings. To compensate this we make wrong decisions in a hurry without thinking through things in the long term
- ***In this frenetic race, we forget one of the most important values of all : patience.***
- Performing daily consistent actions, sustained over the long period of time will help us reach our goals.
- To achieve long-term goals in our personal / professional life, you must regain control of our attention and rewire our brain to focus on the long term. To do so we must stay away from highly stimulating activities
- Amazon that was founded in 1994 had to wait until 2003 to have its first profitable year. Jeff Bezos could have made profits earlier, but instead he decided to reinvest in his business to create string foundations. **We must build our foundations for success one brick at a time. Build them strong so that they won't collapse at the first obstacle or setback**

> Long term thinking is the secrete of achieving our goals. It won't happen today or tomorrow. We must develop the art of patience and consistency. To do so we must eliminate the distractions that makes ue feel restless. Remove external stimulations that prevent you from focusing on the long term picture.

- Today's society is designed in a way to distract and over stimulate you to empty our pockets effectively and thoroughly as possible.

### Action Step

> Write down the steps when you feel your brain is hijacked like. "My brain is being hijacked when...."

## You're overstimulated

- One of the primary reason for procrastination is overstimulation
- When we are calm and focused we find our work very easy to do. We find excited to make progress in our tasks to reach out goal.
- The problem is we are often not calm and focused we rush through our day, running in a hamster wheel, we can never complete our work.
- We let interruptions kill our focus and you waste hours checking your emails and doing other stuffs.
- It starts in the morning when we check out phones, as we check through emails and social media apps we get our first shot of dopamine and we continue to spend more time on them and thus being overstimulated.
- Now when you try to start to work you feel distracted and fancy to do other non important works like replying to a email, having a coffee, re-ordering your file structure. As a result we are back in the hamster wheel receiving more and more stimulation.

### The problem with overstimulation

- Engaging in highly stimulating activities, makes our brain to keep demanding more and more stimulation. As your level of stimulation raises, regular tasks will appear increasing dull and unappealing.
- The gap between the current high level of stimulation and the lower level of stimulation needed to tackle difficult tasks leads us to procrastinate.

### Action Step

> Write down a specific distraction patterns you often fall into that leads you to the state of overstimulation. For instant it could be checking your facebook etc.,

### The Stimulation traps

- As soon as we enter overstimulation, our mind will play tricks on us to continue and never leave the trance state

#### Trick 1: Returning to work is easy

- The first trick is the brain will convince you that returning to work will be easy. It will say our actions are in our control and we can return to work whenever we want.
- But this is far away from work. Often it takes hours for us to get back to work or even we will postpone our key tasks to next day.

#### Trick 2: You can do it later

- Next trick is it will tell us that we can always do the task later. It will convince us we have lots of time. If we start giving into we will end up angry on ourself for not achieving our potential in the future.

#### Trick 3: Excitement is not the same thing as fulfillment

- When we engage in stimulating activities, our mind sell how fun and enjoyable the activity is. But most of the time these activities are not fulfilling.
- Always ask the question how fulfilling is those activity for you.
- We should work on developing an inner sense of peace and a heightened state of focus. This will give us much more fulfillment in the long run.

#### Trick 4: You're missing out

- Checking emails or news often gives us a feeling that we are in control of our environment. Most often we do not want to reply to the mails or news immediately.
- This kind of thinking results from fear of missing out. And this fear reflects scarcity mindset.
- There will always be more opportunities in the future so we need not keep checking things in the fear or missing out.
- Try to track all the activities in a day that makes you overstimulated. **Awareness will help us to start lowering our level of stimulation and increase our focus on our goals.**

#### Action Steps

> Rate yourself from 0 to 10 on the above 4 traps 0 being least affected and 10 being you often find yourself in this situation.


# The Benefits of a detox

- Major problems preventing us from doing our work is stimulation. So to concentrate and do our work we must reduce our stimulation level. This process is known as dopamine detox.
- **The reduction of stimulation to prevent overstimulation and put you in the proper state of mind to tackle major task is dopamine detox**
- When we are not overly stimulated, seemingly challenging, boring and tedious tasks become more appealing and easier to tackle.

## The 48 - hour complete dopamine detox

- Once we have the list place it somewhere so it is clearly visible.

## Step 2: Add friction

- Generally, harder something is to access, less likely we will do it and vise versa.
- Try to add frictions for the activities that you do not want to engage in. For eg. turn off all notifications in your phone, switch off your phone before start to work. This will make us resist a bit to the stimulating activities
- Try to add as much frictions as possible between you and the habits that you want to do.
- This can seemingly simple but highly effective.
- **The more difficult you make it to engage in unwanted activities the better**
- Conversely try to make the activities that you want to as frictionless as possible in your environment. You can still procrastinate but making these activities frictionless will reduce those changes.

### Action Step

> Look at the Do not list and write down ways you can add friction for the activity and do the vise versa for the do list write down things you can do to eliminate friction.

## Step 3: Start first think in the morning

- Try to start in the morning before becoming overly stimulated.
- Create a morning routine to start the day positive and with strong focus. Doing this will help you keep your focus throughout the day.
- While selection things to do in the morning routing remember these activities must keep you calm and deepen your focus and not stimulate us. Mediation, stretching can be a good task.

- To strengthen our routing be at the same place at the same time each day to tackle your most important tasks for that day.
- This will greatly help you in increasing your focus.

### 2. Choose a trigger

- As we create a routine choose a specific trigger. It can be anything making tea, finishing mediating session.
- This will clam our mind and after that we can start our work

### 3. Get started

- Starting your work and spending few mins on it will build enough momentum to keep going. We might even feel the **flow**.
- The more relaxed we are the easier it will be to focus.
- Not to worry about completing the task our not feeling creative or motivated. Starting the task will generate motivation and stimulate creativity.

## Beware of open systems

- Open systems are the biggest source of distractions
- Open system is an application or a situation that provided you with continuous and never ending supply of external stimuli. Eg. of facebook, youtube
- When we interact with a open system we risk ourself of being over stimulated. One we are overstimulated we find ourself struggling to work
- We must try to design closed systems and try to start our day in a closed system
- By closed system try to open only the required software for work and not any other software. Try not to checkout phone in the morning.
- By starting your day in a closed system we can avoid overstimulation and work on challenging tasks.
