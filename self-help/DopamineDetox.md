# Introduction

- If we concentracte our time on single task we can make progress in our life in achiveing our big dreams and goals. But we do no do that every morning we tend to check email, our stock portfolio and tend to spend time slip by without working on the actual job we need to work on.
- Soon enough the important task will become less appealing. As we do other activities and time passes by it creates a mental barrier between us and the task. This is due to overstimulation of our brain.

# Dopamine and the role it plays

- Dopamine gives us the desire to take action to earn the exciting reward that's is waiting for us.
- Dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. 
- A simple event can trigger the release of dopamine but it doesn't mean it is something we like or get pleasure from.
- No amount of stimulation can bring us the sense of fulfillment. Yet many of us are overstimulated looking for the next source of event that can trigger the release of dopamine. The more we seek the worst it becomes
- Under an overstimulated brain any activity that requires concentration or mandane works becomes very difficult to perform.
