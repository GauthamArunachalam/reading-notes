- Thibaut Meurisse

# Introduction

- If we concentrate our time on single task we can make progress in our life in achieving our big dreams and goals. But we do no do that every morning we tend to check email, our stock portfolio and tend to spend time slip by without working on the actual job we need to work on.
- Soon enough the important task will become less appealing. As we do other activities and time passes by it creates a mental barrier between us and the task. This is due to overstimulation of our brain.

# Dopamine and the role it plays

- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that makes us anticipate rewards.
- Dopamine gives us the desire to take action to earn the exciting reward that's is waiting for us.
- Dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. 
- A simple event can trigger the release of dopamine but it doesn't mean it is something we like or get pleasure from.
- No amount of stimulation can bring us the sense of fulfillment. Yet many of us are overstimulated looking for the next source of event that can trigger the release of dopamine. The more we seek the worst it becomes
- Under an overstimulated brain any activity that requires concentration or mundane works becomes very difficult to perform.

## Action Step

- What are you addicted to?
- What are the main sources of stimulation?
- Do they really make you happy?

# The problem

- Dopamine can we seen as a **molecule of more**. The more our environment or actions trigger the release of dopamine, the more we'll want the next shot of dopamine. This self reinforcing mechanism is how addictions work.
- By continuously triggering the release of dopamine through different means we actually strengthen their tolerance to such stimulation. As a result, they need stronger and stronger stimulus to experience the same sensation of pleasure.
- If we can't spend a day without engaging in certain activities it means we are probably addicted to it.
- As we reduce our exposure to stimulating activities we increase our focus and boost our productivity levels.

## Action step

- Write down situations when you couldn't stop doing something. Write down activities that you cannot stay away from on whole day.

## Dopamine neurotransmitters are being hijacked

- Our focus is the most scarce asset, this is the reasons why companies spend billions to attract your attention. The more we spend time in social media and streaming apps the more they can generate revenue through adds. 
- One of the greatest tools they have developed and use in the modern day is the notifications. Which increases our dopamine effect to check that.
- A best example of your brain being hijacked is notifications. Whenever we see a notification we anticipate a reward you'll receive when clicking on it, which triggers the release of dopamine in your brain.
- The development of sophisticated algorithms to suggest content are not helping us it hooks us in a ever ending loop.
- These things hijacks our focus and makes us unproductive and restless
- There are many other activities that can hijack your brain visiting youtube, checking stock portfolio are some of them
- They risk overstimulation and result in loosing your focus.
- People who stay away from internet and social media for a few days, what a waste of time and focus such activities can be

### Food craving

- Experiments have shown that the combination of sugar and fat is especially effective in stimulating the brain's reward system
- Using this food industry adds sugar in most of the processed foods to increase our craving so we buy those products
- Sugar as addictive capability at the level of nicotine but not in the drugs like heroine

## Dopamine and constant stimulation can impair your ability to think long term

- One of the best predictors of success is the ability to think long term
- People who repeatedly focus on where they want to be in future tend to make better decisions in the present.
- Unfortunately, these days, focusing on our long-term goals isn't an easy feat. Many external forces lead us to become caught up in short-term thinking and encourage us to fall for immediate gratification.
- Social media and internet as a whole, have negative impact in out life's by not allowing us to think long-term and not allowing us to focus deeply on the task in front of us. 
- Apple CEO Steve Jobs prohibited his children from using phones or tables even thought is business is to sell those to his customers.
- Former executive of Facebook, Chamath Palihapitiya argues we must rewire our brain to focus on the long term, which starts by removing social media apps from our phones. In his words social media apps **wire your brain fro super-fast feedback**
- By receiving constant feedback through likes and comments we condition ourselves to expect fast results with everything we do.
- As we demand more and more simulation, our focus is increasing geared toward the short term and our vision of reality becomes distorted. this leads us to adopt inaccurate mental models like success should come quickly and easily. Don't need to work hard to lose weight or make money.
- Ultimately, this error prone models make our blurs our vision or reality and our perception of time. This makes us feel jealous about people who had overnight success. Makes feel inadequate, not enough and other negative feelings. To compensate this we make wrong decisions in a hurry without thinking through things in the long term
- ***In this frenetic race, we forget one of the most important values of all : patience.***
- Performing daily consistent actions, sustained over the long period of time will help us reach our goals.
- To achieve long-term goals in our personal / professional life, you must regain control of our attention and rewire our brain to focus on the long term. To do so we must stay away from highly stimulating activities
- Amazon that was founded in 1994 had to wait until 2003 to have its first profitable year. Jeff Bezos could have made profits earlier, but instead he decided to reinvest in his business to create string foundations. **We must build our foundations for success one brick at a time. Build them strong so that they won't collapse at the first obstacle or setback**

> Long term thinking is the secrete of achieving our goals. It won't happen today or tomorrow. We must develop the art of patience and consistency. To do so we must eliminate the distractions that makes ue feel restless. Remove external stimulations that prevent you from focusing on the long term picture.

- Today's society is designed in a way to distract and over stimulate you to empty our pockets effectively and thoroughly as possible.

### Action Step

- Write down the steps when you feel your brain is hijacked like. "My brain is being hijacked when...."

## You're overstimulated

- One of the primary reason for procrastination is overstimulation
- When we are calm and focused we find our work very easy to do. We find excited to make progress in our tasks to reach out goal.
- The problem is we are often not calm and focused we rush through our day, running in a hamster wheel, we can never complete our work.
- We let interruptions kill our focus and you waste hours checking your emails and doing other stuffs.
- It starts in the morning when we check out phones, as we check through emails and social media apps we get our first shot of dopamine and we continue to spend more time on them and thus being overstimulated.
- Now when you try to start to work you feel distracted and fancy to do other non important works like replying to a email, having a coffee, re-ordering your file structure. As a result we are back in the hamster wheel receiving more and more stimulation.

### The problem with overstimulation

- Engaging in highly stimulating activities, makes our brain to keep demanding more and more stimulation. As your level of stimulation raises, regular tasks will appear increasing dull and unappealing.
- The gap between the current high level of stimulation and the lower level of stimulation needed to tackle difficult tasks leads us to procrastinate.

### Action Step

- Write down a specific distraction patterns you often fall into that leads you to the state of overstimulation. For instant it could be checking your facebook etc.,
