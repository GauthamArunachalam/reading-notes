## Role of Algorithms in Computing

> ***Algorithm Definition:***
> An Algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a finiate amount of time.

- It is sequence of computational steps that transforms the input into the output
- A tool for solving a well-specified **computational problem**
- The problem statement specifies the input, output and the relationship between them for a problem instance. The algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship for all problem instances.

> ***Problem Instance***
> A example set of inputs that are given in the problem statement are said as an instance of a problem

- An algorithm for an computational problem is correct if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts (finishes its computing in finite time) and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance.
- Incorrect algoritms never halt for some inputs or halts with incorrect output. 
- Incorrect algorithms are sometimes useful, if we can control the error rate

### Practical applications of algorithms

- A logistic company can map the path the vechile needs to travel to maximise efficiency and minimise fuel
- A doctor can use to determine if the patient as tumour or not based on the branin scan

## Data Structure

> ***Data Structure***
> A data strucute is way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

- Using the appropriate data structure(s) is important part of algo design
- No single Data strcute works for all needs so we must have good understanding the strenghts and limitations of several of them

## Hard Problems

- Usual measure of efficiency is speed
- For some problems we have no algo that runs in resonable time. These subset of problems are known as NP-complete
