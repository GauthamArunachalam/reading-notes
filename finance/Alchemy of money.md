## Money

- It is a medium for transferring value from a producer of goods and services to a consumer of goods and service
- The challenge of the barter system was not all producers needed the products and services that others had which led to a mismatch in the supply and demand and thus a medium of exchange was required. Hence precious metals made as coins are used as medium of exchange.
- ***Seigniorage*** - Denotes the right of the government to mint money. Meaning : the right of the lord to mint money.
- The difference in the value of the money and the cost of minting becomes the revenue for the government. For eg. a 100 Rs note can be minted using 3.51 Rs.
- When the seigniorage turns negative sovereign discontinues the minting of unprofitable denominations
