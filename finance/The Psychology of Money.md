# Intoduction : The Greatest Show on Earth

- Doing good with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.
- Behaviour is hard to teach, even to really smart people
- A genius who losses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. 
- Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealth if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal mesaure of intelligence
- All it takes to accumulate wealth is to save money and invest in good quaility stock and wait for decads for the savings to compound
- The above statement is the moral of the Ronald Reads story a janitor for 17 years when passed away at 92 left 8 million dollors
- Finance is the only field where the playfield is equal for both someone with no formal education on it and for a person with ivy school degree in the field
- **Financial success is not hard science. It is a soft skill. where how you behvae is more important than what you know.**
- Finance is alwasys thought as a function of math, where we use the formulas and the result tells us what to do. The problem occurs when in our head when we try to do it
- Through collective trail and error over the years we have become farmer, pulmber, chemist and etc., But this is not the case with the money and one of the main reason for that is we are taught about money in ways like physics and maths with rules and laws and not like psychology with emotions and nuance
> To learn about something the best way is to start writing about it. It makes us learn more about it increasing our knowledge
- During the 2008 financial crisis no one was able to accurately explain it what happended or why it happend or what needs be done
- Money offers us lessons on things that apply to many areas of life like risk, confidence and happiness
- The reason why people certain things with their money can be explained by psychology and history than the actual math behing the finance
> "History never repeats itself, man always does" - Voltaire

# No One's Crazy

- Your personal experiences with money make up maybe. 0.0000000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.
- Every individual in life is born, thought, grows up and experiences money in different views and angles based upon their situations, family background and other things. So everyone have a different anchoring point with which they view money. Everyone has a different point and thus a thing that makes sense to one can seem crazy to another
- Individuals go through life with differenet beleifs, goals and forcasts. Not because one is smarted then the other or one has better information. But because we all have diferent life's shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences
- No amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the prower of fear and uncertainity
- Studying history makes you feel like we understood something. But not until we live throught it and personally felt the consequences, we may not understand the it enough to change our behaviour
- **"Some lessons needs to experienced before they can be understood" - Michael Batnick**
- In theory people should make investment decisions based on their goal and the properties of the investment options available to them.
- Economist found that people's lifetime investment decisions are heavily achored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation, specially experiences early in their adult lift
- Individual investors willingness to bear risk depends on personal history
- Our experinces in lift does not only affect the opportunities you come acrossl it affects what you think of about those opportunities when they're presented to us
- For eg., A person born in 1970 sees almost 10 times growth in stock market in his teens and 20's. For a person born in 1950 the stock market went no where in thier teens and 20's. Thus for 2 groups of people. sepearted by the chance of the birth year, go through life with completely different views about how stock market work
- Anothe eg. can be inflation for people born in 1960 in thier teens and 20's prices went up by 3 folds compared to a person in 1990 where inflation layed low
- In Nov 2009 nationwide unemployment in America was 10%, but for african american males aged 16 to 19 without a diploma it was 49%
- During world war 2 the German and Japan stock markets where wiped off. After the war, German famrs can only produce food to provide 1000 calories / day for it citizens. Compared to US the stock market more then doubled during the war.
- **Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into thier unique mental models of how the world works**
- People can be mis-informed, have incomplete information, bad at match, lured in my bad markeing but the decision people make sense to them at that time. We tell ourself a story about what we are doing is right and this story is shaped by our own unique experiences
- A eg. case of this is buying lottery tickets
- 40% of Americans cannot come up with $400 in emergency. But a lower income household spends around $412 dollors in buying lottery ticket every year. These 2 groups of people have a major overlap.
- If you are not part of this lower income group who buys lottery we will not be able to understand the subconsious resoning of doing something where one in million has a change of winning big
- Buying lottery is the only time where they can have hopes of living a tangable dream that is the rational behind them buying those tickets
- One other main resason for so much misbehaviour around personal finance is the concept is so new and can be considered as infant comparing to money itself.
- The concept of retirement is just 2 decades old, until world war 2 people worked until they died.
- Index funds are just 50 years old and hedge funds are just 25 years old so we do not have a very big historical data to back and help us make informed decision

# Luck and Risk

- Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
- Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forced other than individual efforts.
- Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer Lakeside School in Seattle.
- In 1968 there were 303 million high school students in the world, 18 million in the US, 270,000 in Washington, 100,000 in Seattle, 300 in Lakeside school
- In in a million high school students attended the high school that had the combination of cash and foresight to buy a computer. Bill Gates happended to be one of them
- Luck and risk happens because life is to complex to allow 100% of your actions to dicate 100% of your outcomes
- You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones your consciously take
- Both Luck and risk are hard to measure and hard to accept
- The economist Robert Shiller says that one of the most important ascpect to think is "The exact role of luck in successful outcomes"
- When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jelouse and mean, even if we know it exists. And when judging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too demoralizing to accept
- Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes among brothers are more correalted than height or weight. (That is one person is right and tall it is more likely his brother is rich than he is tall)
- The quality of education we recieve and the doors that open for use depends hevialy upon the socioeconmic status of our parents
- As like success, failure is also hard to determine where it is due to a serious of bad decisions or did we just end up on the side of risk
- For eg. if we buy a stock and 5 years later is goes nowhere. It's possible that can be bad decision or a good decision with 80% change of making money but it happened to end up on the 20% side
- Statiscially calculation every decision in lift is not possible
- We judge someone else failure to be caused by bad decisions but our own failures are counted to the dark side of risk. Our brain comes up with narratives for our own failures while for others we tend to mark it as bad decision
- News does not cover a investor good decision which ended up in the side of risk but covers okish or bad decision which ended up on the side of luck. So we cannot learn from these lessons as we do not know the propotion of luck in those stories
- The business man Cornelius Vanderbilt and Johb D Rockefeller run their business by avoiding outdated laws. They are formally known as successfull businessman. But thier stories can be flipped if the law acted upon them and their ventures where closed
- So it is hard to say if it is their sage wisdom or did they end up on the side of luck
- People praise Mar Zuckerberg as genius for turing down Yahoo's offer of 1 Billion in 2006, while they critise for Yahoo's turning down its buyout of Microsoft while they can not have predicted this at that time
- Risk, luck and skill can never be pin pointed readily obseved
- **Be careful who you prise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.**. Keep in mind not 100% of our outcomes can be attributed towards effort and decisions
- **Focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns**
- Studying individuals is risks as we tend to only see exterme examples like CEO's or exterme failure situations covered in news
- The more extrement the outcome higher the probaility it is influenced by extreme luck or risk. So applying thier example in our lives is not possbile
> ***To get actionable takeways we need to look the broad patterns of success and failures.***
