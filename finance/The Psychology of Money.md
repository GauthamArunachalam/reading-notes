# Intoduction : The Greatest Show on Earth

- Doing good with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.
- Behaviour is hard to teach, even to really smart people
- A genius who losses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. 
- Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealth if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal mesaure of intelligence

- **Financial success is not hard science. It is a soft skill. where how you behvae is more important than what you know.**
- Finance is alwasys thought as a function of math, where we use the formulas and the result tells us what to do. The problem occurs when in our head when we try to do it
- Through collective trail and error over the years we have become farmer, pulmber, chemist and etc., But this is not the case with the money and one of the main reason for that is we are taught about money in ways like physics and maths with rules and laws and not like psychology with emotions and nuance

# No One's Crazy

- Your personal experiences with money make up maybe. 0.0000000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.
- Every individual in life is born, thought, grows up and experiences money in different views and angles based upon their situations, family background and other things. So everyone have a different anchoring point with which they view money. Everyone has a different point and thus a thing that makes sense to one can seem crazy to another
- Individuals go through life with differenet beleifs, goals and forcasts. Not because one is smarted then the other or one has better information. But because we all have diferent life's shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences
- No amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the prower of fear and uncertainity
- Studying history makes you feel like we understood something. But not until we live throught it and personally felt the consequences, we may not understand the it enough to change our behaviour
- **"Some lessons needs to experienced before they can be understood" - Michael Batnick**
- In theory people should make investment decisions based on their goal and the properties of the investment options available to them.
- Economist found that people's lifetime investment decisions are heavily achored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation, specially experiences early in their adult lift
- Individual investors willingness to bear risk depends on personal history
- Our experinces in lift does not only affect the opportunities you come acrossl it affects what you think of about those opportunities when they're presented to us
- For eg., A person born in 1970 sees almost 10 times growth in stock market in his teens and 20's. For a person born in 1950 the stock market went no where in thier teens and 20's. Thus for 2 groups of people. sepearted by the chance of the birth year, go through life with completely different views about how stock market work
- Anothe eg. can be inflation for people born in 1960 in thier teens and 20's prices went up by 3 folds compared to a person in 1990 where inflation layed low

- **Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into thier unique mental models of how the world works**
- People can be mis-informed, have incomplete information, bad at match, lured in my bad markeing but the decision people make sense to them at that time. We tell ourself a story about what we are doing is right and this story is shaped by our own unique experiences
- A eg. case of this is buying lottery tickets
- 40% of Americans cannot come up with $400 in emergency. But a lower income household spends around $412 dollors in buying lottery ticket every year. These 2 groups of people have a major overlap.
- If you are not part of this lower income group who buys lottery we will not be able to understand the subconsious resoning of doing something where one in million has a change of winning big
- Buying lottery is the only time where they can have hopes of living a tangable dream that is the rational behind them buying those tickets
- One other main resason for so much misbehaviour around personal finance is the concept is so new and can be considered as infant comparing to money itself.
- The concept of retirement is just 2 decades old, until world war 2 people worked until they died.
