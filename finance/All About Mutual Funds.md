# All About Mutual Funds

- Anand Srinivasan

- Mutual funds are schemes floated by a trust to pool or aggregate money from many retail investors and allot them units of face value usually 10. The fund manager deploys the collected money in assets as stated in the scheme document and manages the same. 
- Mutual funds can invest funds in variety of assets like equity, debt etc or a fixed mix of these assets pre determined in the scheme document.
- Selecting the mutual fund to invest depends upon 2 things the time horizon we are ready to stay invested and the economic circumstances.
- To invest directly in equities one must be equipped with knowledge to analyze the individual stocks. Unless we are equipped for this its better to **invest in low cost index funds with low expense ratio and low tracking error**
- An investment in  any asset class comes with its own set of risks. Mutual funds invests their funds in multiple classes of assets. The performance and protection of capital depends upon the state of the underlying asset at that point in time.
- Even gilt funds that invest only in government securities lose their capital when the interest rates of the government bonds go up.
- Investing and tax saving are 2 independent requirements. One should not invest with only the intention of tax saving. Especially in Equity linked savings scheme when the markets are at a all time high.
- Before investing in mutual funds try to understand the near-term market outlook of the underlying asset.
- It is very difficult to predict which active fund manager will be able to consistently beat the index. **Its better to invest small amounts in regular intervals in index funds for the next 20 years.**
- The selection of fund to invest depends on the time horizon we plan to invest. The larger the time horizon the greater the time of compounding. The rate of compounding depends upon the risk we are willing to take. For long term it is better to stay invested in low cost index funds. Its better to stay invested for at least of couple of market cycles to get good returns. If time horizon is short term of medium term its advised to stay in liquid funds.
- It is better not to invest lumpsum in mutual funds instead we can invest the lumpsum amount in bond with 9% coupon rate or higher and invest the interest in mutual funds or direct equity. The only exemption to the case is to invest in liquid case for short term.
- To select the bond fund to invest in the interest rate cycle at that time is very important. When the interest rates are going up which means the value of the bond will fall in this situation invest in short term bond funds. If the interest rates are going down the bond value will increase it is a good time to invest in long term bond funds.
- Analyzing the past 20 years international data 90% of the active funds fails to outperform over passive funds
- For a well informed investor with a good corpus and a risk appetite, one can switch a large portion of corpus between debt and equity fund depending upon the economics cycle for better returns. When interest rates are high and earnings are stagnating it is a good time to have your funds in debt funds, when the overvaluation in equity comes to an end the debt funds must be sold and converted into index funds.
- NRI can invest in mutual funds through NRE/NRO accounts.
- In case of erosion in the value of the underlying assets in mutual funds one must analysis the economic climate and look for any signification changes in the economic cycle if nothing is changed its better to continue investing if there are any changes its times to move the SIP to another underlying asset by changing the fund.
- **Alpha is the excessive return over the benchmark index**
- Ratings of mutual funds are just opinions of rating agencies it should not affect one's investment decisions for non index funds one must track the holdings of a fund and see if the fundamental logic behind the investment still exists if it is intact there is no sense to switch the funds.
- There 2 fundamental reasons for price raise in equity
    - The underlying earnings of the stock continue to increase at a higher than average rate. This is called investment returns
    - Even when the earnings are not increasing the market participants are willing to pay higher. This is called speculative returns.
    - Investment returns are sustainable and low volatile. While speculative returns are not sustainable and caused by excess liquidity in the economy.
- A novice investor must invest his funds in large cap stocks are equal amount in Nifty 50 and Nifty next 50. If the investor has some risk appetite he can invest in full market index fund.
- Returns on mutual fund depends upon the earning growth in the underlying companies which will mostly inline with the nominal GDP growth. The earning of the company move up or down based upon the various macro economic factors.
- To allow your investments grow and let compounding do its wonders we need to opt for growth funds instead of dividend yielding funds.
- For international exposure one can invest in international low cost index funds. With 2 benefits of rupee falling against the dollar and earnings increase of those companies. Its better to avoid fund of funds as it brings in double expense ratio.
- The most important thing in investment is setting a purpose. If the purpose for the investment is set then finding a avenue for investing can become easy. Unless one requires money the only reason to sell your investments the underlying logic behind the investment is no longer valid.
- Building your retirement corpus depends upon few things
    - The length of the runway - The time you have till your retirement. The longer we have the greater amount of corpus one can create
    - The rate at which you compound - Its the rate at which your capital increases. For equity it is the growth of the earnings for bonds it is the percentage of interest we received.
    - The amount we are willing to commit every month - this will act as the growth fuel for your wealth creation
    - If one has 20 years of runway it is advised to invest 30% of their income.
