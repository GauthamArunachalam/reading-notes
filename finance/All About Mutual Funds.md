# All About Mutual Funds

- Anand Srinivasan

- Mutual funds are schemes floated by a trust to pool or aggregate money from many retail investors and allot them units of face value usually 10. The fund manager deploys the collected money in assets stated in the scheme document and manages the same. 
- Mutual funds can invest funds in variety of assets like equity, debt etc or a fixed mix of these assets pre determined in the scheme document.
- Selecting the mutual fund to invest depends upon 2 things the time horizon we are ready to stay invested and the economic circumstances.
- To invest directly in equities one must be equipped with knowledge to analyze the individual stocks. Unless we are equipped for this its better to **invest in low cost index funds with low expense ratio and low tracking error**
- An investment in  any asset class comes with its own set of risks. Mutual funds invests their funds in multiple classes of assets. The performance and protection of capital depends upon the state of the underlying asset at that point in time.
- Even gilt funds that invest only in government securities lose their capital when the interest rates of the government bonds go up.
- Investing and tax saving are 2 independent requirements. One should not invest with only the intention of tax saving. Especially in Equity linked savings scheme when the markets are at a all time high.
- Before investing in mutual funds try to understand the near-term market outlook of the underlying asset.
- It is very difficult to predict which active fund manager will be able to consistently beat the index. **Its better to invest small amounts in regular intervals in index funds for the next 20 years.**
- The selection of fund to invest depends on the time horizon we plan to invest. The larger the time horizon the greater the time of compounding. The rate of compounding depends upon the risk we are willing to take. For long term it is better to stay invested in low cost index funds. Its better to stay invested for atleast of couple of market cycles to get good returns. If time horizon is short term of medium term its advised to stay in liquid funds.
- It is better not to invest lumpsum in mutual funds instead we can invest the lumpsum amount in bond with 9% coupon rate are higher and invest the interest in mutual funds or direct equity. The only exemption to the case is to invest in liquid case for short term.
