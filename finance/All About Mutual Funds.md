# All About Mutual Funds

- Anand Srinivasan

- Mutual funds are schemes floated by a trust to pool or aggregate money from many retail investors and allot them units of face value usually 10. The fund manager deploys the collected money in assets as stated in the scheme document and manages the same. 
- Mutual funds can invest funds in variety of assets like equity, debt etc or a fixed mix of these assets pre determined in the scheme document.
- Selecting the mutual fund to invest depends upon 2 things the time horizon we are ready to stay invested and the economic circumstances.
- To invest directly in equities one must be equipped with knowledge to analyze the individual stocks. Unless we are equipped for this its better to **invest in low cost index funds with low expense ratio and low tracking error**
- An investment in  any asset class comes with its own set of risks. Mutual funds invests their funds in multiple classes of assets. The performance and protection of capital depends upon the state of the underlying asset at that point in time.
- Even gilt funds that invest only in government securities lose their capital when the interest rates of the government bonds go up.
- Investing and tax saving are 2 independent requirements. One should not invest with only the intention of tax saving. Especially in Equity linked savings scheme when the markets are at a all time high.
- Before investing in mutual funds try to understand the near-term market outlook of the underlying asset.
- It is very difficult to predict which active fund manager will be able to consistently beat the index. **Its better to invest small amounts in regular intervals in index funds for the next 20 years.**
- The selection of fund to invest depends on the time horizon we plan to invest. The larger the time horizon the greater the time of compounding. The rate of compounding depends upon the risk we are willing to take. For long term it is better to stay invested in low cost index funds. Its better to stay invested for at least of couple of market cycles to get good returns. If time horizon is short term of medium term its advised to stay in liquid funds.
- It is better not to invest lumpsum in mutual funds instead we can invest the lumpsum amount in bond with 9% coupon rate or higher and invest the interest in mutual funds or direct equity. The only exemption to the case is to invest in liquid case for short term.
- To select the bond fund to invest in the interest rate cycle at that time is very important. When the interest rates are going up which means the value of the bond will fall in this situation invest in short term bond funds. If the interest rates are going down the bond value will increase it is a good time to invest in long term bond funds.
- Analyzing the past 20 years international data 90% of the active funds fails to outperform over passive funds
- For a well informed investor with a good corpus and a risk appetite, one can switch a large portion of corpus between debt and equity fund depending upon the economics cycle for better returns. When interest rates are high and earnings are stagnating it is a good time to have your funds in debt funds, when the overvaluation in equity comes to an end the debt funds must be sold and converted into index funds.
- NRI can invest in mutual funds through NRE/NRO accounts.
- In case of erosion in the value of the underlying assets in mutual funds one must analysis the economic climate and look for any signification changes in the economic cycle if nothing is changed its better to continue investing if there are any changes its times to move the SIP to another underlying asset by changing the fund.
- **Alpha is the excessive return over the benchmark index**
- Ratings of mutual funds are just opinions of rating agencies it should not affect one's investment decisions for non index funds one must track the holdings of a fund and see if the fundamental logic behind the investment still exists if it is intact there is no sense to switch the funds.
- There 2 fundamental reasons for price raise in equity
    - The underlying earnings of the stock continue to increase at a higher than average rate. This is called investment returns
    - Even when the earnings are not increasing the market participants are willing to pay higher. This is called speculative returns.
    - Investment returns are sustainable and low volatile. While speculative returns are not sustainable and caused by excess liquidity in the economy.
- A novice investor must invest his funds in large cap stocks are equal amount in Nifty 50 and Nifty next 50. If the investor has some risk appetite he can invest in full market index fund.
- Returns on mutual fund depends upon the earning growth in the underlying companies which will mostly inline with the nominal GDP growth. The earning of the company move up or down based upon the various macro economic factors.
- To allow your investments grow and let compounding do its wonders we need to opt for growth funds instead of dividend yielding funds.
- For international exposure one can invest in international low cost index funds. With 2 benefits of rupee falling against the dollar and earnings increase of those companies. Its better to avoid fund of funds as it brings in double expense ratio.
- The most important thing in investment is setting a purpose. If the purpose for the investment is set then finding a avenue for investing can become easy. Unless one requires money the only reason to sell your investments the underlying logic behind the investment is no longer valid.
- Building your retirement corpus depends upon few things
    - The length of the runway - The time you have till your retirement. The longer we have the greater amount of corpus one can create
    - The rate at which you compound - Its the rate at which your capital increases. For equity it is the growth of the earnings for bonds it is the percentage of interest we received.
    - The amount we are willing to commit every month - this will act as the growth fuel for your wealth creation
    - If one has 20 years of runway it is advised to invest 30% of their income.
- While investing in bonds the interest from the bonds must be reinvested in equity or bond the investor should not consume this income as it stops wealth creation and compounding process.
- Unit linked insurance policy is schema created by insurance companies as mutual funds industry got its wings in the early 2000's. In this scheme in first years investment 30% of amount is taken as agents commission and another part is taken as administrative charges. In a given year only 75 to 85% of the invested amount is actually deployed to the market making inferior returns. So it is better to say away from this.
- A fund that is more than 65% of its capital is considered as equity fund and less than 65% is considered as debt fund.
- **Successful investors are those who never interrupt the process of compounding.**
- Once a investor reaches his financial goal it is prudent that he liquidates his investments and move to bonds or debt funds to protect his capital even thought he has to forgo some of his return percentage.
- It is very difficult for anyone to predict the peek of the market. If you feel the market is at is high and correction is eminent we can shift our SIPs to short term liquid funds. If the corpus is substantial it is better to move some of that into fixed instrument and start a fresh SIP in the index fund.
- If one feels there is a sharp correction in market once can temporary increase in SIP installments by reducing his other expenses till the market bounces back.
- It is better to invest in existing funds than new funds for 2 reasons
    - In existing funds we have track record of the fund and the fund manager. Its performance and investing style of the manager
    - In new funds we do not have the track which makes it very difficult to track it.
- It is better to invest stocks and mutual accounts in joint accounts as it creates visibility and can have access to both the partners. In case of single account in case tragedies it is tedious time consuming process to claim control over the assets.

> A rule of thumb should be if the combined P/E of the market is less than 20 then it is a good time to invest in equity. If the P/E is greater than 22 its time to consider to move your SIP to debt funds.

- We can invest in **hybrid P/E** ratio funds which invests in equity is the P/E is below the predetermined levels and changes its investment to debt it P/E moves over the value. In this type of funds investor does not get entire upside of the equity and also is not affected by downside of a falling market.

> Side Pocketing in Debt funds - When AMCs lend money to corporate and they default. The AMCs hope to recover those funds in the future. In the meantime an investor can sell his units and have no benefit from the recovery. To avoid such cases SEBI as ordered AMC to bundle the non performing assets into a new fund and allot units in that fund proportionate to their holdings in the original fund. Thus when recovery happens and the investor owns the newly created fund he can benefit from that.

- If a mutual fund gives 40% return in a single year usually this can be due to excess liquidity in the market. There are high chances that the fund will under perform in the near future. It is difficult to maintain the same level of returns because money will chase performance as the AMU increases it is difficult to keep the same returns. In this case we can exit the fund and move the capital to a debt instrument and start a fresh SIP.
- One can invest surplus cash that are required in 3 to 6 months in short term liquid funds.

> The first rule of investing is Capital preservation or as Buffet says "Never loose money"

## Multi asset fund

- Multi asset funds are mutual funds that invest in multiple asset classes. Best eg. are balanced fund, hybrid P/E fund etc.,

## Direct Vs Regular plans

- In Direct plans the investor directly purchases the mutual fund from the AMC probably through a online medium hence it does not attract selling or distribution expense, so the expense ratio of this plan is low.
- In Regular plans someone a individual or institution sells this product to for which they will be compensated by the AMC these charges are included in the direct plans expense ratio.

## Thematic funds

- A difference between a sectoral fund and thematic fund is that, in sectoral fund the fund manager cannot invest in any other company that is not part of the sector. But in thematic funds the manager as a bit of room to invest in different sectors associated with the theme. For eg. a infra themed fund can also invest in cement, pipes, steel etc.
- This gives a edge for the thematic funds over sectoral funds as they have an edge if a sector is in a downward trend they can switch to different sectors associated to it but in sector funds they are stuck with the companies.
- People with good knowledge about these sectors can invest in thematic funds.

## Total index return

- Total index return is an index that tracks the capital gains by the increase in price of the stock and also includes the dividends payed by the companies in the index.
- In regular index only the capital gain from the price increase is considered.
- One of the reason active funds cannot beat the index funds are, an active can hold only 10% of their corpus in a particular stock. Where as 40% of nifty 40 is consisted by the top 10 companies. This does not allow the active funds to have a concentrated portfolio of holding high growth potential companies.

## Multi cap Vs Balanced fund

- Multi cap funds are just equity funds with predetermined portions of corpus to be invested in large, mid and small cap funds.
- Balanced funds can have any percentage of investment in any asset class.

## Balanced fund

- A fund that invest both in debt and equity in a predetermined ratio.
- There are 3 different types of balanced fund. Aggressive , Hybrid P/E and defensive.
- Aggressive funds have majority of capital invested in equity and 15 to 30% invested in debts. This is reversed in case of defensive funds
- In Hybrid funds the ratio of debt and equity various based on the P/E of the market.

## Liquid funds

- For liquid funds held less than 3 years the investors income tax slab level gets applies. If the fund is held for more than 3 years Capital gains tax kicks in at 20% with indexation benefit.
> **Indexation Benefit** - A certain amount of income is set aside for inflation adjustments. The indexation table is published by the gov every year.

## Closed Funds

- These are funds that does not collect capital after the initial fund offering. The collected money is invested in market.
- It is mostly actively managed.
- These funds are listed in a stock exchange and generally trade at a discount to its actual NAV value
- The number of funds of these types are very less
- In US value investors will buy the entire fund value when there is differential to its actual NAV and traded value and liquidate the fund to pocket its value.

## Card based funds

- Liquid funds are competing with the savings bank to attract funds.
- Liquid funds generate a return higher than a standard bank.
- Some liquid funds have created a product that links the liquid fund to an ATM card which we can swipe at online purchases or ATMs. These cards act as a debit card. One must be very careful of such products and void them.

## Identifying multi-baggers

- Attractive valuation, growth visibility for the next ten-years horizon, little or no debt, owner holding and integrity are the key things to consider to identify a multi-bagger
- Buying a great business with good outlook at a high valuation will not give us multi-baggers.
- Growth horizon in both revenue and profit should clear for the next 10 years.
- The business should have a natural moat.
- Avoid companies with debt in the balance sheet.
- Quality of promoter is key metric. Its better to avoid companies where promoters have a low stake.

## Portfolio Management Services

- Discretionary PMS - The fund manager invests the funds in assets of his wish without the investors consent
- Non-Discretionary PMS - The fund manager only suggests the assets and the investor makes the final call.
- They charge a entry load and standard management fee of 2 to 3% with a profit sharing arrangement.

## Turn over ratio

- This tells the percentage of stocks that are sold and been replaced in a time period. The higher the turnover higher the transaction fees which leads to higher expense ratio. The lower turnover ratio means lower costs and a lower expense ratio
